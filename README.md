Entray
======

Simple utility for adding items to the Android notification tray.

Includes a basic app for adding reminders by text or voice. Can also handle "send" intents from other apps (e.g. sharing a URL). Also registers a handler for the voice search "Take a note" command.

Items in the tray can be snoozed for 1 hour or 1 day.

Handles basic time parsing, e.g. "Buy milk 8pm" will set a reminder for 8pm tonight.
